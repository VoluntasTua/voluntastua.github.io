I wasn’t Christian (hadn’t been for two decades) and had recently decided I was an atheist. It just seemed like something any well-educated person should do. I had known some fundamentalists, and they seemed to think the Bible should be read with no mediation or interpretation, so that was how I approached it. Big mistake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Bible, and any sacred text for that matter, needs context. There is no way to make sense of it otherwise. What I didn’t realize at the time was that those fundamentalists brought their own context. By the time they read the Bible, they already “knew” how to interpret it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for why, it’s not just about being well-educated. It’s much more than that. There is no part of this Earth that has not been influenced by what’s written in the Bible, especially if you speak English. We all know about Adam and Eve and Noah’s Ark and the 10 Commandments (even if we can’t remember what they are) and even if we don’t know, they affect us nonetheless. It is in our culture, and therefore in our dreams, affecting us in ways that we can scarcely imagine. So part of coming to terms with our own unconscious must include a critical reading of the Bible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But don’t read it without commentary. I recommend &lt;em&gt;the New Oxford Annotated Bible&lt;/em&gt;. And be sure to read the introductory essays and footnotes. Otherwise you’ll just get lost.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="religion" /><summary type="html">The first time I read the Bible was in 2008.

Diviners and fortune tellers both use the same tools (especially tarot), but in very different ways. Fortune tellers claim to be able to tell you the future. They make statistically informed guesses and measure your reaction. Since most people who go to a fortune teller want to believe, they will tend to focus on what the fortune teller gets “right” and forget what they get wrong. For fortune tellers, tarot cards are merely props.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Divination is quite different. The purpose of divination is to get in touch with the divine. In my last post, I described the gods as aspects of the self or the unconscious that transcend the ego. They are the faces on vast psychic powers that we can scarcely comprehend. When I say “psychic,” I simply mean that they exist in the psyche, not that they are in any way supernatural. But they are nonetheless real from a phenomenological point of view. Furthermore, they often know things you (your ego) do not. This is where divination comes in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Divination is a set of techniques whereby we can access that wisdom through the language of symbols. The oldest and most organic form of divination is dream interpretation. Other forms of divination are essentially methods by which to construct what are essentially waking dreams for the purpose of interpretation. They also provide the ability to generate a sort of shared dream with another person to help them access their own divine wisdom.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="magick" /><summary type="html">How is divination different from fortune telling?

They may be godds, faeries, dæmons, devas, angels, spirits, djinn, &lt;em&gt;etc.&lt;/em&gt; It is remarkable both how widespread this is and also how little conformity there is between how they appear in different cultures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While we cannot rule out the possibility that such beings literally exist, I have yet to see convincing evidence that they do. What definitely does exist, however, are aspects of the mind that appear independent of egoic thought.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If “&lt;a href=&quot;/religion/2021/05/24/god.html&quot;&gt;God&lt;/a&gt;” is the source of the mystery of all existence, we might also call this “the Real.” Then perhaps “the gods” are “the Imaginary.” But being imaginary, they are nonetheless useful and powerful, perhaps even more than “God.” The gods, saints, angels, and even heros, personify forces in our unconscious that can affect us in powerful ways without us even realizing it. And for this reason, it can be useful to engage with them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an exercise, try making an altar to a god, angel, saint, or hero. Don’t worry about whether or not it is “real”. But do try to make it beautiful. As you do so, pay attention to how this deity may appear to you. Perhaps you will notice the name of the deity in places you wouldn’t expect. Or messages may appear to you. Don’t worry about whether there really is something “out there.” Just open yourself to communication from that aspect of yourself.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="magick" /><summary type="html">Cultures from all over the world have concepts of non-human intelligences that sometimes interact with the human world.

To monotheists, these two are one and the same. But, Harari argues, equating the two is confusing at best, deceptive at worst. Deceptive because, according to him, monotheists will cite the first definition in trying to refute atheists. Then, once you accept that argument, they say, “see, so you should agree that homosexuals are damned.” Harari, an atheist, posits that it is improper to use the word “God” for meaning 1, as it leads to confusion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On this last point, I disagree with Harari. The word “God” has a kind of power, like it or not, and we can go further faster if we claim that power rather than work around it. Perhaps you find that you cannot use the word “God” in that way, it has just too many negative connotations. Perhaps you were raised in a fundamentalist family and found liberation in rejecting “God”. Or perhaps you were raised in an atheist family and learned to associate the word “God” with all that is ignorant in humankind. If this is the case, I beg your forgiveness, for I will continue using the word “God” as it suits me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for the second definition above, the cosmic judge, I see that as &lt;a href=&quot;/magick/2021/05/25/godds.html&quot;&gt;a&lt;/a&gt; god (lowercase ‘g’), an archetype in the psychological sense.

As is often the case, both are correct, but in different ways. Sudden enlightenment refers to a change in &lt;em&gt;state&lt;/em&gt; while gradual enlightenment refers to a change in &lt;em&gt;stage&lt;/em&gt; of development. Both are important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My first experience of non-dual awareness happened suddenly; not meditating or praying, but while studying cognitive psychology in a café. I had been on this path for only a year. It remains my most memorable mystical experience. I had a realization of oneness with all consciousness. It could not have happened if not for the study and practice which I had been performing. But what happened after that? “Before enlightenment, chop wood, carry water. After enlightenment, chop wood, carry water.” On one level, everything changes, on another level, nothing changes at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is between those two levels? This is where the gradual approach comes in. It builds a kind of Jacob’s Ladder, between the normal, mundane experience of separateness; and the non-dual, fully-integrated experience of enlightenment. It allows you to move up and down this ladder as you wish. Ultimately, the gradual path can only get you so far. Eventually you need to leap “across the abyss.” But it can help pave the way and connect the two endpoints.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="magick" /><summary type="html">There is an ongoing debate between schools that believe that enlightenment happens suddenly; and those who believe it happens gradually, over a long period of study and practice.

&lt;p&gt;Likewise with light. Most of space is a black void, with occasional photons flowing through. It doesn’t appear this way because your nervous system did not evolve to represent the world as it is, but rather in a way that would be useful. It fills in the gaps. Everything you experience is an illusion your brain constructs, not to represent the world accurately, but it in a way that is useful. It doesn’t matter whether we are talking about an experience of a predator, of food, or of God. They are all internally generated experiences, extrapolated from some (but really, not much) external sense data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, something got lost once it hit the mainstream. The goal of transcending the ego got interpreted to mean the ego is “bad.” This is absurd.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is an abridged version of my chapter, &lt;a href=&quot;/magick/2020/10/20/belief.html&quot;&gt;On Belief and Doubt&lt;/a&gt;, which was originally published in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.weaveandspin.org/cauldron&quot;&gt;the Reclaiming Cauldron&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People tend to conflate faith with belief. They are actually quite different. In fact, they are incompatible. Belief refers to a state in which you take something to be true. I believe the world is round. It would be silly to say, “I have faith the world is round.” In fact, if I did say that, you might wonder, “why do you doubt it?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Faith requires doubt. It only makes sense when there is reason not to believe. A friend is faithful only because she could be otherwise. Faith is about trust.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider what it means to believe in science versus having faith in science. To believe in science means to believe the scientific method works, that it is an effective way to reach truth. To have faith would mean you trust the scientific endeavor is ultimately good. These are two completely separate notions. It’s entirely to believe that science is true but not necessarily good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What about religion? To believe in religion is to apply the scientific worldview to a mythic reality. It is ultimately incoherent. As for faith, it depends. Christianity and Islam are big on faith. Faith plays a role in Buddhism and Hinduism as well, though not as central. When a Buddhist says, “I take refuge in the Buddha,” it is like saying, “I have faith in the Buddha.” You can take refuge without necessarily believing the Buddha was even real. Other religions may not care much about faith at all.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="religion" /><summary type="html">This is an abridged version of my chapter, On Belief and Doubt, which was originally published in the Reclaiming Cauldron</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Visualization Exercise 1</title><link href="https://www.deeperwisdom.org/magick/2021/05/19/exercise1.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Visualization Exercise 1" /><published>2021-05-19T00:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2021-05-19T00:00:00-07:00</updated><id>https://www.deeperwisdom.org/magick/2021/05/19/exercise1</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://www.deeperwisdom.org/magick/2021/05/19/exercise1.html">&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&quot;/magick/2021/05/18/imagination.html&quot;&gt;my last post&lt;/a&gt; I talked about the role of imagination as the screen or gateway between your conscious mind and the unconscious intelligences that lie within. For many of us, our imagination, particularly our capacity to visualize, has atrophied since childhood. It can take practice to build up your ability to maintain a steady and stable image in your imagination. However, doing so opens the door to having valuable and potentially life-changing conversations in the inner world. It is valuable to be able to “visualize” all of your senses, including your sense of proprioception (so you can experience movement in the inner world) but for now, we will start with visual.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Start by visualizing a simple symbol in front of you. That could be a symbol of special significance to you, such as a cross, or the Star of David. If you don’t have such a symbol, or you’d like to try something different, I recommend a five-pointed star, or pentagram. The pentagram is useful as it is a symbol of power and protection while also being a symbol of love and life. It also symbolizes completeness, representing the four Platonic elements (Earth, Air, Water, Fire) plus the fifth element, or quintessence. Practice visualizing this as a flaming pentagram, in front of you, about a meter in diameter. Once this becomes easy, try visualizing four of them, in front, behind, and on either side of you.&lt;/p&gt;

I also mentioned how we typically interact with the unconscious through dreams. However, since remembering your dreams is challenging and requires a fair bit of discipline (at a time when you are least likely to have it–that is, first thing in the morning, before coffee) I’d like to propose another method for working with the unconscious intelligences: active imagination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The phrase “active imagination” can be confusing because it is the imagination that is principally active, not you. That’s not to say you are entirely passive, either, but that the imagination takes on a kind of life of its own, like a waking dream. We can think of the imagination as a kind of screen between the conscious and unconscious aspects of your mind-system. Either side can project onto that screen and can interact through it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Building up your imagination takes practice. Most of us fell out of practice somewhere around adolescence, when the external world started to become much more interesting. As a result, for many of us, our capacity for visualization has atrophied. But with practice, you can bring it back. One way of doing this is through guided visualizations. This is not active imagination, because it is constrained by the guide. But it is a good (and often fun) way to develop your imaginative capacity.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="magick" /><summary type="html">In recent posts, I raised the topic of taking an intentional stance with respect to aspects of your mind-system that lie beneath consciousness; or cultivating an I/Thou relationship with your inner dæmon.
