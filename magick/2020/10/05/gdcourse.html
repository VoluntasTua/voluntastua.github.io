<p><strong>Description:</strong> While the original Order of the Golden Dawn lasted only fifteen years, and ended over a century ago, its influence on what is known broadly as the Western Mystery Tradition, is extraordinarily deep. Indeed, it would be difficult to find an esoteric, magic(k)al, or occult organization in the West that hasn’t been influenced by the Golden Dawn (including and especially the rise of Paganism and other religious movements in the 20th century). Part of the reason for this has to do with the incredible syncretism that appeared in the mysterious cypher manuscripts, weaving together many diverse streams including Hermeticism and Neo-Platonism, Christian and Jewish Kabbalah, ancient Greco-Roman and Egyptian mythologies, Alchemy, Astrology, Theurgy, and Tarot among others. These cypher manuscripts described a system of initiation and education taking the aspirant through five grades in the Outer Order. Later additions added a Portal Grade as well as a series of Inner Order grades. This course will focus on those five original Outer Order grades, exploring their historical context as well as the many layers of symbolism involved in these rituals. While this course does not presume to “initiate” anyone, students who complete the course will have a thorough-going understanding of the methods and symbols involved in the Golden Dawn Order as well as how to apply these teachings to their own spiritual development.</p>
