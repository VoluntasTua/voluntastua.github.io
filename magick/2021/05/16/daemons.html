      Speaking with Dæmons
    </h1>
  

  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>“My name is legion,” said the dæmoniac, “for we are many.” In fact, we all have a great host of dæmons within us. Not devils in the Christian sense (at least not until we reject them and they go into our shadow); more like daemons in the computing sense: background processes that run outside of the direct control of the “user” or, in this case, the conscious will. John Yates would actually say that there is no “self” to consciousness at all. Rather, consciousness is more like a screen onto which different dæmons, or intelligences project information in such a way that the whole mind-system can apprehend.</p>

<p>These intelligences appear to us in many different ways. When they rise to consciousness, we generally identify with them. So instead of saying “the system that governs my appetite is hungry,” you just say “I am hungry”. Other aspects of the mind-system may never rise to consciousness, such as systems that govern perspiration or digestion. Still others may approach the threshold but not totally cross it. When we have an intuition about something, but don’t fully understand why, this is a part of the mind-system, a kind of unconscious intelligence, delivering partial information into consciousness. These intelligences can appear in dreams. When you dream, you often have interactions with aspects of your mind-system with which you might otherwise never be aware.</p>

<p>It is possible to also have interactions with these intelligences through a technique Carl Jung called “active imagination”.</p>
