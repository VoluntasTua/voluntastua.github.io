      Cultivating Your Imagination
    </h1>
  

  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>In recent posts, I raised the topic of taking an intentional stance with respect to aspects of your mind-system that lie beneath consciousness; or cultivating an I/Thou relationship with your inner dæmon. I also mentioned how we typically interact with the unconscious through dreams. However, since remembering your dreams is challenging and requires a fair bit of discipline (at a time when you are least likely to have it–that is, first thing in the morning, before coffee) I’d like to propose another method for working with the unconscious intelligences: active imagination.</p>

<p>The phrase “active imagination” can be confusing because it is the imagination that is principally active, not you. That’s not to say you are entirely passive, either, but that the imagination takes on a kind of life of its own, like a waking dream. We can think of the imagination as a kind of screen between the conscious and unconscious aspects of your mind-system. Either side can project onto that screen and can interact through it.</p>

<p>Building up your imagination takes practice. Most of us fell out of practice somewhere around adolescence, when the external world started to become much more interesting. As a result, for many of us, our capacity for visualization has atrophied. But with practice, you can bring it back. One way of doing this is through guided visualizations. This is not active imagination, because it is constrained by the guide. But it is a good (and often fun) way to develop your imaginative capacity.</p>
