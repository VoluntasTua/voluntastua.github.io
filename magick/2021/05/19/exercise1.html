  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>In <a href="/magick/2021/05/18/imagination.html">my last post</a> I talked about the role of imagination as the screen or gateway between your conscious mind and the unconscious intelligences that lie within. For many of us, our imagination, particularly our capacity to visualize, has atrophied since childhood. It can take practice to build up your ability to maintain a steady and stable image in your imagination. However, doing so opens the door to having valuable and potentially life-changing conversations in the inner world. It is valuable to be able to “visualize” all of your senses, including your sense of proprioception (so you can experience movement in the inner world) but for now, we will start with visual.</p>

<p>Start by visualizing a simple symbol in front of you. That could be a symbol of special significance to you, such as a cross, or the Star of David. If you don’t have such a symbol, or you’d like to try something different, I recommend a five-pointed star, or pentagram. The pentagram is useful as it is a symbol of power and protection while also being a symbol of love and life. It also symbolizes completeness, representing the four Platonic elements (Earth, Air, Water, Fire) plus the fifth element, or quintessence. Practice visualizing this as a flaming pentagram, in front of you, about a meter in diameter. Once this becomes easy, try visualizing four of them, in front, behind, and on either side of you.</p>
