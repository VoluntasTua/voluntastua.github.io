      On Ego
    </h1>
  

  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>There’s a misconception that the ego is bad. The worst thing a spiritual person could be is egoistic. But what is meant by “ego?” The word came into English by way of Freud’s translator. Freud put forth a tripartite model of mind consisting of “the It”, “the I”, and “the Over-I”. To make Freud sound more scholarly, his English translator preferred the Latin: <em>Id</em>, <em>Ego</em>, and <em>Superego</em>. In Freud’s conception, the “I”, or <em>ego</em>, is not bad. It’s simply the part you associate with yourself. None of them are bad, though we often treat “the it” as if it were, dissociating ourselves from “it”.</p>

<p>So if <em>ego</em> is just the Latin word for “I”, how did it get a bad rap? Spiritual thinkers say the goal is to transcend the <em>ego</em>. So far as this line of thinking goes, I am in agreement with it.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, something got lost once it hit the mainstream. The goal of transcending the ego got interpreted to mean the ego is “bad.” This is absurd.</p>

<p>It’s like wings transcending wheels. Once a plane takes off, the wheels are useless. But if a plane didn’t have any wheels, you would be concerned. How will it take off? A plane without wheels can’t take off. Just as we need wheels in order to transcend the need for wheels, so do we need an ego, and a well developed one at that, in order to transcend it.</p>
