      What is Enlightenment?
    </h1>
  

  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>There is an ongoing debate between schools that believe that enlightenment happens suddenly; and those who believe it happens gradually, over a long period of study and practice. As is often the case, both are correct, but in different ways. Sudden enlightenment refers to a change in <em>state</em> while gradual enlightenment refers to a change in <em>stage</em> of development. Both are important.</p>

<p>My first experience of non-dual awareness happened suddenly; not meditating or praying, but while studying cognitive psychology in a café. I had been on this path for only a year. It remains my most memorable mystical experience. I had a realization of oneness with all consciousness. It could not have happened if not for the study and practice which I had been performing. But what happened after that? “Before enlightenment, chop wood, carry water. After enlightenment, chop wood, carry water.” On one level, everything changes, on another level, nothing changes at all.</p>

<p>What is between those two levels? This is where the gradual approach comes in. It builds a kind of Jacob’s Ladder, between the normal, mundane experience of separateness; and the non-dual, fully-integrated experience of enlightenment. It allows you to move up and down this ladder as you wish. Ultimately, the gradual path can only get you so far. Eventually you need to leap “across the abyss.” But it can help pave the way and connect the two endpoints.</p>
