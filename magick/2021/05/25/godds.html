      What are gods?
    </h1>
  

  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Cultures from all over the world have concepts of non-human intelligences that sometimes interact with the human world. They may be godds, faeries, dæmons, devas, angels, spirits, djinn, <em>etc.</em> It is remarkable both how widespread this is and also how little conformity there is between how they appear in different cultures.</p>

<p>While we cannot rule out the possibility that such beings literally exist, I have yet to see convincing evidence that they do. What definitely does exist, however, are aspects of the mind that appear independent of egoic thought.</p>

<p>If “<a href="/religion/2021/05/24/god.html">God</a>” is the source of the mystery of all existence, we might also call this “the Real.” Then perhaps “the gods” are “the Imaginary.” But being imaginary, they are nonetheless useful and powerful, perhaps even more than “God.” The gods, saints, angels, and even heros, personify forces in our unconscious that can affect us in powerful ways without us even realizing it. And for this reason, it can be useful to engage with them.</p>

<p>As an exercise, try making an altar to a god, angel, saint, or hero. Don’t worry about whether or not it is “real”. But do try to make it beautiful. As you do so, pay attention to how this deity may appear to you. Perhaps you will notice the name of the deity in places you wouldn’t expect. Or messages may appear to you. Don’t worry about whether there really is something “out there.” Just open yourself to communication from that aspect of yourself.</p>
