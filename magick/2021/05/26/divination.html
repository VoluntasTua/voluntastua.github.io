      Divination is not Fortune Telling
    </h1>
  

  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>How is divination different from fortune telling? Diviners and fortune tellers both use the same tools (especially tarot), but in very different ways. Fortune tellers claim to be able to tell you the future. They make statistically informed guesses and measure your reaction. Since most people who go to a fortune teller want to believe, they will tend to focus on what the fortune teller gets “right” and forget what they get wrong. For fortune tellers, tarot cards are merely props.</p>

<p>Divination is quite different. The purpose of divination is to get in touch with the divine. In my last post, I described the gods as aspects of the self or the unconscious that transcend the ego. They are the faces on vast psychic powers that we can scarcely comprehend. When I say “psychic,” I simply mean that they exist in the psyche, not that they are in any way supernatural. But they are nonetheless real from a phenomenological point of view. Furthermore, they often know things you (your ego) do not. This is where divination comes in.</p>

<p>Divination is a set of techniques whereby we can access that wisdom through the language of symbols. The oldest and most organic form of divination is dream interpretation. Other forms of divination are essentially methods by which to construct what are essentially waking dreams for the purpose of interpretation. They also provide the ability to generate a sort of shared dream with another person to help them access their own divine wisdom.</p>
