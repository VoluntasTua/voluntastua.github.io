    <p>Time is both linear and circular. It’s linear in that there’s a beginning, a middle, and an end. You’re born, you live, you die. It’s circular in that along with this linearity, we also experience periodic cycles, from day to year, and onward to generations.</p>

<p>As industrialized humans, we tend to focus on the linear dimension. We are more interested in how the future will be different from the past than in how it will be the same. But for most of human history, the opposite was true. While the rate of linear change has increased exponentially, the circular dimension remains the dimension that connects us to the non-human.</p>

<p>The cycles of nature, especially the solar cycles, have a sort of holographic quality. The macro is reflected in the micro. Every day is like a mini year. Dawn is spring, noon is summer, dusk is autumn, and midnight is winter. Every life goes through the same cycle. This can be represented in space according to the relative direction of the Sun. Where the Sun rises (in the East) represents Spring and birth. The Sun at mid-day (South in the Northern hemisphere) is youth. Where the Sun sets (West) is middle age. And where the Sun is hidden (North in the Northern hemisphere) is death.</p>

<p>Associating these archetypal forms with their directions is useful in working with them. For example, when working with something new, face the East. When working with the threshold of death, face the Northwest.</p>
