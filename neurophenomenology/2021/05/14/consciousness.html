      What are the limits of consciousness? What lies beneath?
    </h1>
  

  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">
    <p><a href="/neurophenomenology/2021/05/13/10percent.html">Yesterday</a> I wrote about how you only use a small percentage of your brain. But the notion that <em>*you* use *your*</em> brain is actually an illusion. Your brain is not your possession. Saying that you use a portion of your brain is like saying a wave uses a portion of the ocean. It would be more accurate to say that a portion of the ocean produces a wave.</p>

<p>So what about the rest of the ocean (your brain)? If your consciousness is limited to just a tiny bit of neural activity (probably in the left temporal lobe) is that just the cage of your virtual reality, like in <em>the Matrix</em>? Not quite. Consider the wave metaphor again. While a wave accounts for only an infinitesimal part of the ocean, its bounds are not fixed. There is no clear line where the wave begins and ends. The wave has no clear border.</p>

<p>What about consciousness? Its borders are also fuzzy. There are data that are clearly 100% in consciousness, that is, in your active working memory (like the words you are reading now). There are data that are 100% outside of your consciousness (like that which controls the functioning of your liver). And then there’s stuff on the threshold, like the feeling of your shirt against your skin, or the taste of your tongue. That threshold, or limen (from which we get subliminal) is where things get interesting. That’s where concepts like intuition come in.</p>
