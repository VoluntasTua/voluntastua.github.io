      Intuition, Fast and Slow
    </h1>
  

  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">
    <p><a href="/neurophenomenology/2021/05/14/consciousness.html">Yesterday</a> I wrote about the limits of consciousness, and the <em>limen</em> of consciousness (from which we get subliminal) and how that’s where intuition lies. Savvy readers might notice that the title of this post is an homage to Daniel Kahneman’s book, <em>Thinking, Fast and Slow</em>. Like thinking, there are two types of intuition: fast and slow. In fact, fast intuition is the same as Kahneman’s fast thinking System 1. It is the subject of Malcolm Gladwell’s book Blink. It is a system by which you are able to quickly make judgements about the world by virtue of entrained patterns. It is tacit knowledge. It’s the knowledge that you’ve internalized so well that you have, in fact, forgotten it.</p>

<p>But what about the other kind of intuition? If Kahneman’s System 1 is what I’m calling “fast intuition” and his System 2 is slow, deliberate, conscious thought, then this is System 3. This system also operates across the limen between conscious and unconscious processing, but it takes time. It’s what you use when you tell someone, “let me sleep on it.” You are taking in new information that is too complex for System 2 to process effectively. So you let your unconscious work on it for a while before you come to a decision. Maybe the answer comes in a dream. Or maybe it’s just a felt sense of what’s right that you can’t quite explain. But this was no snap judgment. This took time.</p>
