      Cultivating an I/Thou relationship with your unconscious
    </h1>
  

  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>How do you know I’m not a zombie? How do you know that anyone other than yourself has consciousness at all? Sound solipsistic? It is. But if you think about it, there’s no way you can really <em>know</em> that anyone other than yourself has an inner world. We <em>assume</em> it because we see other people act in ways that seem, to us, to be intentional. From this, we form what’s called a “theory of mind” about other people. For most of us, this begins in early childhood, when the child begins to realize that she is separate from her parents. We somehow come to the conclusion that some things are sentient and some things aren’t.</p>

<p>If solipsism is the belief that nothing (besides yourself) is sentient, then animism is the belief that everything is sentient. Most of us lie somewhere in between these two extremes. The more a thing is like us, the more likely we are to ascribe it sentience, if only unconsciously. Think of how much easier it is to anthropomorphize a smart home device that talks to you than a mute device like a clock or even a computer. I sometimes wonder, if we were to meet an extraterrestrial intelligence, how likely it is we would recognize it as such.</p>

<p>But what about those “intelligences” within you I wrote about <a href="/magick/2021/05/16/daemons.html">yesterday</a>? Should we ascribe sentience to them? It may seem like an odd question, but I suggest that it is valuable to do so, to adopt an intentional stance towards them. This will help you cultivate an I/Thou relationship with your unconscious, rather than an I/It relationship, and I suggest that doing that will be far more fruitful.</p>
