      The Universe is Black and Empty
    </h1>
  

  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>It’s well known that most of matter is empty space. Between the nucleus of an atom and it’s electron shell is a vast void. Even most of the electron shell is empty most of the time. The only reason anything <em>seems</em> solid is because the electrons at the edge of your skin repel the electrons at the edge of what you “touch”. From a subatomic perspective, nothing ever touches anything (excepting nuclear fusion). It’s like two magnets repelling each other. Think about this the next time you walk across the floor. In a manner of speaking, your feet never really touch the ground.</p>

<p>Likewise with light. Most of space is a black void, with occasional photons flowing through. It doesn’t appear this way because your nervous system did not evolve to represent the world as it is, but rather in a way that would be useful. It fills in the gaps. Everything you experience is an illusion your brain constructs, not to represent the world accurately, but it in a way that is useful. It doesn’t matter whether we are talking about an experience of a predator, of food, or of God. They are all internally generated experiences, extrapolated from some (but really, not much) external sense data.</p>

<p>This is why I like to say, “the universe is black and empty.” I find it to be a useful reminder that my perception is not the world.</p>
