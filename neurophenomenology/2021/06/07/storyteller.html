      The Brain as Storyteller
    </h1>
  

  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>In the mid-20th century, some folks with intractable epilepsy underwent a heroic surgery to separate the two halves of the brain by cutting the corpus callosum. What was remarkable was that, at first, nothing seemed very different about them. But after interviewing them, some clever researchers came up with some interesting experiments to see what had changed. One experiment in particular tells us a lot about how we construct our sense of self.</p>

<p>In this experiment, the person with the split brain was shown two images: one to the left hemisphere, and one to the right. Remember: the left hemisphere is responsible for language. Also, each hemisphere controls the opposite side of the body. So the right hemisphere controls the left hand. The person was shown a chicken foot and a snowy field to the left and right hemispheres respectively. They were asked to pick what went with what they saw. The right hemisphere, seeing the snowy field, directed the left hand to point to a snow shovel. They were asked why they picked that. The left hemisphere, controlling language, having seen the chicken foot and their left hand picking the snow shovel (but NOT the snowy field) said, without hesitation: “to clean out the chicken shed.”</p>

<p>They did not say, “I don’t know,” or “that’s strange.” The brain <em>immediately</em> came up with a story to explain its behavior. <em>This is what it does all the time.</em> This is not pathological behavior. This is how the brain normally works.</p>
