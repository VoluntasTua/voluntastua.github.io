  <p><em>This is an abridged version of my chapter, <a href="/magick/2020/10/20/belief.html">On Belief and Doubt</a>, which was originally published in <a href="https://www.weaveandspin.org/cauldron">the Reclaiming Cauldron</a></em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>People tend to conflate faith with belief. They are actually quite different. In fact, they are incompatible. Belief refers to a state in which you take something to be true. I believe the world is round. It would be silly to say, “I have faith the world is round.” In fact, if I did say that, you might wonder, “why do you doubt it?”</p>

<p>Faith requires doubt. It only makes sense when there is reason not to believe. A friend is faithful only because she could be otherwise. Faith is about trust.</p>

<p>Consider what it means to believe in science versus having faith in science. To believe in science means to believe the scientific method works, that it is an effective way to reach truth. To have faith would mean you trust the scientific endeavor is ultimately good. These are two completely separate notions. It’s entirely to believe that science is true but not necessarily good.</p>

<p>What about religion? To believe in religion is to apply the scientific worldview to a mythic reality. It is ultimately incoherent. As for faith, it depends. Christianity and Islam are big on faith. Faith plays a role in Buddhism and Hinduism as well, though not as central. When a Buddhist says, “I take refuge in the Buddha,” it is like saying, “I have faith in the Buddha.” You can take refuge without necessarily believing the Buddha was even real. Other religions may not care much about faith at all.</p>
