      What is God?
    </h1>
  

  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>In his book <em>21 Lessons for the 21st Century</em>, Yuval Noah Harari identifies two definitions of God: 1) the source of the mystery of all existence, and 2) a cosmic judge. To monotheists, these two are one and the same. But, Harari argues, equating the two is confusing at best, deceptive at worst. Deceptive because, according to him, monotheists will cite the first definition in trying to refute atheists. Then, once you accept that argument, they say, “see, so you should agree that homosexuals are damned.” Harari, an atheist, posits that it is improper to use the word “God” for meaning 1, as it leads to confusion.</p>

<p>On this last point, I disagree with Harari. The word “God” has a kind of power, like it or not, and we can go further faster if we claim that power rather than work around it. Perhaps you find that you cannot use the word “God” in that way, it has just too many negative connotations. Perhaps you were raised in a fundamentalist family and found liberation in rejecting “God”. Or perhaps you were raised in an atheist family and learned to associate the word “God” with all that is ignorant in humankind. If this is the case, I beg your forgiveness, for I will continue using the word “God” as it suits me.</p>

<p>As for the second definition above, the cosmic judge, I see that as <a href="/magick/2021/05/25/godds.html">a</a> god (lowercase ‘g’), an archetype in the psychological sense. Powerful, though not exactly real.</p>
