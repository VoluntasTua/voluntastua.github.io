      Why and How to Read the Bible
    </h1>
  

  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>The first time I read the Bible was in 2008. I wasn’t Christian (hadn’t been for two decades) and had recently decided I was an atheist. It just seemed like something any well-educated person should do. I had known some fundamentalists, and they seemed to think the Bible should be read with no mediation or interpretation, so that was how I approached it. Big mistake.</p>

<p>The Bible, and any sacred text for that matter, needs context. There is no way to make sense of it otherwise. What I didn’t realize at the time was that those fundamentalists brought their own context. By the time they read the Bible, they already “knew” how to interpret it.</p>

<p>As for why, it’s not just about being well-educated. It’s much more than that. There is no part of this Earth that has not been influenced by what’s written in the Bible, especially if you speak English. We all know about Adam and Eve and Noah’s Ark and the 10 Commandments (even if we can’t remember what they are) and even if we don’t know, they affect us nonetheless. It is in our culture, and therefore in our dreams, affecting us in ways that we can scarcely imagine. So part of coming to terms with our own unconscious must include a critical reading of the Bible.</p>

<p>But don’t read it without commentary. I recommend <em>the New Oxford Annotated Bible</em>. And be sure to read the introductory essays and footnotes. Otherwise you’ll just get lost.</p>
